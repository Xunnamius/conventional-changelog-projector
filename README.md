# @xunnamius/conventional-changelog-projector

This preset is a fork of
[conventional-changelog-conventionalcommits](https://www.npmjs.com/package/conventional-changelog-conventionalcommits)
built to work within the
[projector ecosystem](https://github.com/Xunnamius/projector).

> For now, see the original
> [conventional-changelog-conventionalcommits](https://www.npmjs.com/package/conventional-changelog-conventionalcommits)
> package for usage examples and related documentation.

## Install

```bash
npm install --save-dev @xunnamius/conventional-changelog-projector
```

If you're using
[`lernaPackage`](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/tree/master/packages/conventional-changelog-core#lernapackage)
or
[`tagPrefix`](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/tree/master/packages/conventional-changelog-core#tagPrefix)
configuration options, consider installing the
[fixed version of conventional-changelog](https://github.com/Xunnamius/conventional-changelog)
([see also](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/pull/865)).
For example:

```bash
npm install --save-dev https://xunn.at/conventional-changelog-cli
```

## Differences from Upstream

Along with several bug fixes (regex mangling, sorting problems, etc), what
follows are the major differences versus upstream.

### A Few Style Tweaks

Specifically:

- The scope is bolded
- Scope-less subjects are made sentence case
- The first line of the subject of breaking changes are bolded and sentence
  cased (scope is excluded)
- Reverts are italicized; malformed reverts are normalized
- Better grammar from
  [conventional-recommended-bump](https://www.npmjs.com/package/conventional-recommended-bump)

### Removed `release-as` Footer Line Support

Since this configuration is used primarily in
[`semantic-release`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/semantic-release)-based
flows, there is no reason to store release information in commit footers.

### No Longer Returns Promises

Calling
[conventional-changelog-conventionalcommits](https://www.npmjs.com/package/conventional-changelog-conventionalcommits)
emits a Promise, making the result impossible to reference in synchronized code
(babel plugins, semantic-release config files, some cli consumers, npm scripts,
etc).

This fork avoids the pain, allowing one shared configuration to be consumed by
[`conventional-changelog-core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/conventional-changelog-core),
[`conventional-changelog-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/conventional-changelog-cli)
via command line,
[`semantic-release`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/semantic-release) via release
configuration, [`projector`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xunnamius/projector)
and
[`projector-pipeline`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xunnamius/projector-pipeline)
at various points in the CI/CD pipeline, and other sync and async tooling.

> This also means `configOverrides` cannot be a Promise.

### Easier to Customize

When configuring
[conventional-changelog-conventionalcommits](https://www.npmjs.com/package/conventional-changelog-conventionalcommits),
drilling down into the
[config object](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/tree/master/packages/conventional-changelog-core#config)
and altering something like
[`writerOpts.transform`](https://github.com/conventional-changelog-archived-repos/conventional-changelog-writer#transform)
is not so easy. This fork allows you to tweak and chain invocations rather than
_completely overwrite_ these key functions via the various
[config](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog-config-spec)
[keys](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/tree/master/packages/conventional-changelog-core#config).
See
[the function docs](https://github.com/Xunnamius/conventional-changelog-projector/blob/main/index.js#L8)
for more details.

### Simpler Source Organization

"Simplified" the source code by concentrating default configuration to a
[single file](./defaults.js) with the all the configuration knobs easily
accessible among the topmatter.

### Updated to Use Modern JS/Typescript

This fork uses a modern Babel-based build chain, is written in TypeScript, is
fully typed, and supports modern debugging practices.

> This will be true in the next minor version üòÖ
