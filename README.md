# conventional-changelog-unconventional

This is a fork of and drop-in replacement for
[conventional-changelog-conventionalcommits](https://www.npmjs.com/package/conventional-changelog-conventionalcommits).
Along with various bug fixes (regex string mangling, sorting problems, etc),
what follows are the major differences:

### Updated to use modern JS/TypeScript

This rewrite uses a modern Babel-based build chain, is written in TypeScript, is
fully typed, and supports modern debugging practices.

> This will be true in the next version ðŸ˜…

### A few style tweaks

Specifically:

- The scope and the first line of the subject of breaking changes are made bold
- Scope-less subjects are made sentence case
- Reverts are italicized; malformed reverts are normalized
- Better grammar from
  [conventional-recommended-bump](https://www.npmjs.com/package/conventional-recommended-bump)

### Removed `release-as` footer line support

Since this configuration is used primarily in
[`semantic-release`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/semantic-release)-based
flows, there is no reason to store release information in commit footers.

### No longer returns Promises

Requiring and calling
[conventional-changelog-conventionalcommits](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/tree/master/packages/conventional-changelog-conventionalcommits)
emits a Promise, making the result impossible to reference in synchronized code
(babel plugins, semantic-release config files, conventional-X-cli config). This
fork avoids the pain, allowing one shared configuration to be consumed by
[`conventional-changelog-core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/conventional-changelog-core),
[`conventional-changelog-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/conventional-changelog-cli) via command line, [`semantic-release`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/semantic-release) via release
configuration, [`projector`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xunnamius/projector) and
[`projector-pipeline`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xunnamius/projector-pipeline) at
various points in the CI/CD pipeline, and other sync and async tooling.

> This also means `configOverrides` cannot be a Promise.

### Easier to customize

With
[conventional-changelog-conventionalcommits](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/tree/master/packages/conventional-changelog-conventionalcommits),
drilling down into the resultant
[config object](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/tree/master/packages/conventional-changelog-core#config)
and altering something like
[`writerOpts.transform`](https://github.com/conventional-changelog-archived-repos/conventional-changelog-writer#transform)
is difficult, especially if you only want to tweak rather than _completely
overwrite_ it. This fork makes deep customizations, including extending rather
than overwriting the default functionality, easier. Just pass your
[config](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog-config-spec)
[overrides](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/tree/master/packages/conventional-changelog-core#config),
which will be used to _tweak_ the default configuration (see
[the exported function itself](https://github.com/Xunnamius/conventional-changelog-unconventional/blob/main/index.js#L8)
for details).

### Simpler source organization

Simplified the source code by concentrating default configuration to a
[single file](./defaults.js) with the all the configuration knobs easily
accessible among the topmatter.
